## Contribution

Create a `Pull Request`, request a review, merge to master.

## Deployment

The latest changes in the project should be on the `master` branch. The default branch for deployments is `gh-pages`. Do not commit to this branch, the latest changes are going to be pushed during the deployment step.

In order to deploy the latest changes, checkout to the `master` branch, `fetch & pull` and run the following script:

```bash
# generate static project in dist/ folder
yarn run generate

# only deploy dist/ folder to GitHub Pages
yarn run deploy
```

The deployment script is going to publish the changes to the `gh-pages` branch and serve it to https://infoabend.weitblicker.live
