## Contribution

Create a `Pull Request`, request a review, merge to main.

## Deployment

The latest changes in the project should be on the `main` branch. The default branch for deployments is `gh-pages`. Do not commit to this branch, the latest changes are going to be pushed during the deployment step.

In order to deploy the latest changes, you only need to commit to the `main` branch, the deployment is going to be made by github Actions.

In case, you changed Files under `static/` you need to deploy once manually:

```bash
# generate static project in dist/ folder
yarn run generate

# only deploy dist/ folder to GitHub Pages
yarn run deploy
```

The deployment script is going to publish the changes to the `gh-pages` branch and serve it to https://infoabend.weitblicker.live
