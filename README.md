## Project Setup
We use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) as a CSS preprocessor
- recommended way to install it `gem install sass`

#### Usage:
2 ways of preprocessing:
- after modifying .sass files run `sass assets/sass/main.scss  assets/css/main.css`
- listen on the .sass files during development: `sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css`

both ways processes sass files into the main.css file.

## Contribution
Create a `Pull Request`, request a review, merge to master.

## Deployment
The latest changes in the project should be on the `master` branch. The default branch for deployments is `gh-pages`. Commits made to this branch are going to be deployed by the system. To deploy latest changes, merge the `master` into `gh-pages` branch.
