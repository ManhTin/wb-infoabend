## Project Setup
We use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) as a CSS preprocessor
- recommended way to install it `gem install sass`

#### Usage:
2 ways of preprocessing:
- after modifying .sass files run `sass assets/sass/main.scss  assets/css/main.css`
- listen on the .sass files during development: `sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css`

both ways processes sass files into the main.css file.
